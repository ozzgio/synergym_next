## Milestone 1: Foundation üîÑ (20% Complete)

### System Overview
```mermaid

    A[User] --> B[Web Interface]
    B --> C[Rails Application]
    C --> D[PostgreSQL Database]
    C --> E[Redis Cache]
    C --> F[Sidekiq Background Jobs]
```

**Implementation Status:** Partially Complete
- ‚úÖ Rails 8 application structure
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis caching configured (basic setup)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sidekiq background jobs configured (no jobs implemented)

### User Authentication Flow
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Web
    participant Rails
    participant DB
    
    User->>Web: Visit /users/sign_up
    Web->>Rails: GET /users/sign_up
    Rails->>Web: Render sign up form
    Web->>User: Display form
    User->>Web: Submit registration
    Web->>Rails: POST /users
    Rails->>DB: Create user record
    DB->>Rails: Return user
    Rails->>Web: Redirect to sign in
    Web->>User: Display sign in form
```

**Implementation Status:** Partially Complete
- ‚úÖ Devise authentication implemented
- ‚úÖ Registration and login flows functional
- ‚úÖ Session management configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google OAuth configured (limited testing)

## Milestone 2: Role-based Architecture ‚è≥ (Not Started)

### Role-based Authorization
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Guest] --> B[Sign Up]
    B --> C[Athlete]
    C --> D[Sign In]
    D --> E[Trainer]
    D --> F[Admin]
    F --> G[Full Access]
    E --> H[Limited Access]
    C --> I[Basic Access]
```

**Implementation Status:** Not Started
- ‚ùå User roles defined (enum exists) but not enforced
- ‚ùå Pundit authorization policies (basic setup only)
- ‚ùå Role-based controllers (placeholder only)
- ‚ùå Dashboard routing by role (placeholder views only)

## Milestone 3: Scalability ‚è≥ (Not Started)

### Deployment Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Heroku"
        A[Web Dyno] --> B[Worker Dyno]
        A --> C[PostgreSQL Addon]
        B --> D[Redis Addon]
    end
    
    E[Custom Domain] --> A
    F[GitHub] --> G[Heroku Git]
    G --> A
```

**Implementation Status:** Not Started
- ‚ùå Basic Heroku deployment configuration exists but incomplete
- ‚ùå Scaling strategies not implemented
- ‚ùå Monitoring and alerting not added
- ‚ùå Performance optimizations not implemented

## Milestone 4: API Architecture ‚è≥ (Not Started)

**Implementation Status:** Not Started
- ‚ùå No API endpoints implemented
- ‚ùå API authentication not configured
- ‚ùå API documentation not implemented

## Milestone 5: Advanced Integrations ‚è≥ (Not Started)

**Implementation Status:** Not Started
- ‚ùå Third-party integrations not implemented
- ‚ùå Analytics and reporting not configured
- ‚ùå Advanced features not started

## Current Limitations

Based on the actual implementation status, the following limitations exist in the current architecture:

### Authentication & Authorization
- User roles are defined in the model but not enforced in controllers
- Pundit policies exist but are minimal and not comprehensive
- Google OAuth is configured but has limited functionality and testing

### Dashboards & UI
- Dashboard routes exist but contain only placeholder HTML with no functionality
- No role-based access control is implemented
- Navigation is not properly restricted by user role

### Background Processing
- Sidekiq is configured but no actual background jobs are implemented
- Redis is set up but only used for basic Sidekiq functionality

### API Infrastructure
- No API endpoints have been implemented despite documentation claims
- No API authentication or versioning strategies in place

### Testing & Quality
- RSpec is configured but test coverage is minimal
- No integration tests for role-based functionality
